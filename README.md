# GenITA: Generative Image-Text Automated package
## Overview
This repository is independently developed as a felxible framework to generate high-quality Image-Text pairs for finetuning Image-Generation models, such as Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, and other generative models. By leveraging open-source captioning models, GITA automates the process of generating diverse captions for corresponding images, ensuring that the text data is well-suited for downstream applications such as style-specific generations or domain adaptation. This framework is designed to complement, not replace, contemporary repositories or modules in the field, offering an additional option for flexibility and automation to create customized datasets.
